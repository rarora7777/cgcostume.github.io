  "about" : {
  	"en" : "<p>I am broadly interested in utilizing 3D interactions in immersive realities (AR/VR) for design, modelling and fabrication applications. I'm also interested in the full sketch-based/curve-based design pipeline, starting from acquisition, to processing, and finally to surfacing or fabrication.</p>
	<p>Before I took a short 14-hour flight from Delhi to Toronto, I finished my masters and undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur in India. For my masters thesis, I worked with <a href='http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/' target='_blank'>Adrien Bousseau</a> and <a href='http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/' target='_blank'>Vinay P. Namboodiri</a> on shape and view interpolation of design sketches. I worked with <a href='http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rtewari/' target='_blank'>Raghunath Tewari</a> on the complexity of the perfect matching problem during my undergrad.</p>
	<p>I was awarded the <a href='https://research.adobe.com/fellowship/previous-fellowship-award-winners/' target='_blank'>Adobe Fellowship</a> in 2019. My Michell Truss project was selected to be displayed as an exhibit at University of Toronto's Robarts Library. The project was one of three selected in a <a href='https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/grad-exhibit-awards' target='_blank'>university-wide competition</a>. If you are around Robarts between Jan 13 and Feb 29, 2020, please take a look at the exhibit on the first floor!</p>"},
