  	"en" : "<p>I am broadly interested in utilizing interactions in 3D space for design, modelling and fabrication applications. I'm also interested in the full sketch-based/curve-based design pipeline, starting from acquisition, to processing, and finally to surfacing or fabrication.</p>
	<p>Before my 14-hour economy class journey to the University of Toronto, I did my masters and undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur in India. For my masters thesis, I worked with <a href='http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/' target='_blank'>Adrien Bousseau</a> and <a href='http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/' target='_blank'>Vinay P.
