      "abstract"  : "We present the first algorithm for designing volumetric Michell
			Trusses. Our method uses a parametrization approach to generate
			trusses made of structural elements aligned with the primary direc-
			tion of an objects stress field. Such trusses exhibit high strength-to-
			weight ratio while also being aesthetically pleasing.  Unlike tradi-
			tional approaches to structural optimization, our method produces
			trusses that can be edited as a post process but retain structural opti-
			mality. We also demonstrate the structural robustness of our designs
			via mechanical testing. Our algorithm permits an exciting combina-
			tion of control and structural soundness which we believe serves as
			an important compliment to existing structural optimization tools
			and as a novel standalone design tool itself.",

      "abstract"  : "We present SymbiosisSketch, a hybrid sketching system that combines drawing in air (3D) and on a drawing surface (2D) to create detailed 3D designs of arbitrary scale in an augmented reality (AR) setting.
		SymbiosisSketch leverages the complementary affordances of 3D (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and 2D (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions for in situ 3D conceptual design. A defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3D curves.
		These surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3D canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2D tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3D sketch.
		SymbiosisSketch users draw interchangeably on a 2D tablet or in 3D within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in AR.
		Our evaluation study shows this hybrid technique to be easy to use in situ and effective in transcending the creative potential of either traditional sketching or drawing in air.",

      "abstract"  : "Sketching in immersive 3D virtual reality (VR) environments has great potential for a variety of interactive 3D design applications. Precisely sketching the intended strokes in mid-air, however, can be a challenge.
	  In this paper, we present a set of controlled studies to analyze the factors affecting human ability to sketch freely in a 3D VR environment.
	  In our first study, we directly compare traditional sketching on a physical surface to sketching in VR, with and without a physical surface to rest the stylus on.
	  Our results indicate that the lack of a physical drawing surface is a major cause of inaccuracies in VR drawing, and that the effect is dependent on the orientation of the drawing surface.
	  In a second experiment, we evaluate the extent to which visual guidance can compensate for the loss of sketching precision in VR.
	  We found that while additional visual guidance improves positional accuracy, it can be detrimental to the aesthetic quality of strokes.
	  We conclude by distilling our experimental findings into design guidelines for sketching tools in immersive 3D environments.",

      "abstract"  : "A hallmark of early stage design is a number of quick-and-dirty sketches capturing design inspirations, model variations, and 	alternate viewpoints of a visual concept. We present SketchSoup, a workflow that allows designers to explore the design space induced by such sketches. We take an unstructured collection of drawings as input, along with a small number of user-provided correspondences as input. We register them using a multi-image matching algorithm, and present them as a 2D interpolation space.
		By morphing sketches in this space, our approach produces plausible visualizations of shape and viewpoint variations despite the presence of sketch distortions that would prevent standard camera calibration and 3D reconstruction. In addition, our interpolated sketches can serve as inspiration for further drawings, which feed back into the design space as additional image inputs.
		SketchSoup thus fills a significant gap in the early ideation stage of conceptual design by allowing designers to make better informed choices before proceeding to more expensive 3D modeling and prototyping. From a technical standpoint, we describe an end-to-end system that judiciously combines and adapts various image processing techniques to the drawing domain&mdash;where the images are dominated not by color, shading and texture, but by sketchy stroke contours.",

		The Isolation Lemma states that giving a random weight assignment to the edges of a graph ensures that it has a unique minimum weight perfect matching, with a good probability. 
		We derandomize this lemma for K<sub>3,3</sub>-free and K<sub>5</sub>-free bipartite graphs. That is, we give a deterministic log-space construction of such a weight assignment for these graphs. 
		Such a construction was known previously for planar bipartite graphs. 
		Our result implies that the perfect matching problem for K<sub>3,3</sub>-free and K<sub>5</sub>-free bipartite graphs is in SPL.
		It also gives an alternate proof for an already known result&mdash;reachability for K<sub>3,3</sub>-free and K<sub>5</sub>-free graphs is in UL.",
